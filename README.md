# 2. Dataset
The YOLO classification model has been trained on a smaller version of the dataset called [DeepFashion Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khyeh0719/deepfashion). I created a smaller version by taking 5 categories which consist of random images ([**CreateDataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/code/raaggeesingh/traindata). It is consists of categories such as Blouses_Shirts, Cardigans, Denim, Jackets_Vests, Pants.

# 3. Usage
Used this dataset to train the YOLO model.
The dataset was created using [**CreateDataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/code/raaggeesingh/traindata) which can be executed on Kaggle.
The YOLO has been trained on the smaller dataset using [**trainYOLO**](https://www.kaggle.com/code/raaggeesingh/newyolo) which can be executed on Kaggle.
