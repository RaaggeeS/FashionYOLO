# 2. Dataset
The YOLO classification model has been trained on a smaller version of the dataset called [Fashion Produt Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset). I created a smaller version by taking 20 categories which consist of random images ([**CreateDataset**](https://github.com/RaaggeeS/FashionYOLO/blob/main/experiments/CreateDataset.ipynb)). It is consists of categories such as Backpacks, Belts, Briefs, Casual Shoes, Flip Flops, Formal Shoes, Handbags, Heels, Jeans, Kurtas, Perfume and Body Mist, Sandals, Shirts, Socks, Sports, Shoes, Sunglasses, Tops, Tshirts, Wallets and Watches.

# 3. Usage
Used this dataset to train the YOLO model.
